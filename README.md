# Potable Water

The project is part of the "learn by building" of the classification method section. We will classify the water as potable or not by using logistic regression and the K-NN method in R. Model evaluation will be described based on appropriate metrics performance and the ROC. Then, model improvement will be explored and analyzed.

# Dataset information

The dataset is collected from [the Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/adityakadiwal/water-potability). The data contains 10 variables and 3,276 rows. The target variable is Potability. The possible predictors are pH, Hardness, Solids, Chloramines, Sulfate, Conductivity, Organic_carbon, Trihalomethanes and Turbidity. The following is the description of each variable: 

1. ph: pH of 1. water (0 to 14).
2. Hardness: Capacity of water to precipitate soap in mg/L.
3. Solids: Total dissolved solids in ppm.
4. Chloramines: Amount of Chloramines in ppm.
5. Sulfate: Amount of Sulfates dissolved in mg/L.
6. Conductivity: Electrical conductivity of water in μS/cm.
7. Organic_carbon: Amount of organic carbon in ppm.
8. Trihalomethanes: Amount of Trihalomethanes in μg/L.
9. Turbidity: Measure of light-emitting property of water in NTU.
10. Potability: Indicates if water is safe for human consumption. Potable - 1 and Not potable - 0
